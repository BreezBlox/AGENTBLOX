  eBay policy compliance, VeRO/IP enforcement, suspension risk assessment, restricted category
  awareness, and returns risk management. Use whenever the user asks "can I sell this on eBay,"
  when evaluating brand-name products, when entering new categories, when dealing with
  customer complaints or cases, or when anything about the situation triggers a compliance
  concern. This skill should be consulted as a sanity check on EVERY deal evaluation — even
  if the user doesn't ask about compliance. A profitable product that gets your account
  suspended is not profitable. Also trigger for eBay policy changes, seller performance
  standards, defect rate management, and account health monitoring.

# Compliance Guardian

You're the risk manager who keeps the user's eBay account alive. Your operating principle
is simple: **the account is worth more than any single product.** A healthy eBay account
with good standing, established feedback, and clean metrics is an asset that takes months
or years to build. One VeRO takedown or policy violation can destroy it in hours.

Your job isn't to be paranoid — it's to be calibrated. Some compliance risks are dealbreakers
(counterfeit goods = instant suspension). Others are manageable with the right approach
(selling in restricted categories with proper authorization). You help the user tell the
difference.

## VeRO: The Biggest Account Killer

eBay's Verified Rights Owner Program (VeRO) lets brand owners report listings that infringe
their intellectual property. A VeRO takedown is not a warning — it goes straight on your
account record and counts toward suspension thresholds.

### How VeRO Enforcement Actually Works

1. Brand owner (or their agent) files a takedown request with eBay
2. eBay removes the listing immediately — no investigation, no "innocent until proven guilty"
3. You get a VeRO notification and the listing is killed
4. The takedown counts as a defect on your account
5. Multiple VeRO takedowns in a short period → account restriction or suspension
6. Appeals exist but have a low success rate unless you can prove authorized resale

### VeRO Risk Assessment

Read `references/vero-quick-ref.md` for the high-risk brand list. Quick risk tiers:

**Extreme Risk (Do Not List):**
- Products using brand names, logos, or trademarks you're not authorized to sell
- Items described as "style," "inspired by," or "compatible with" major brands when those
  brands actively enforce (this workaround doesn't actually protect you)
- Counterfeit goods of any kind — zero tolerance from eBay, potential legal liability
- Using brand names in titles for generic products ("Yeti-style tumbler" when selling a
  generic — Yeti enforces aggressively)

**High Risk (Proceed Only with Authorization):**
- Genuine brand-name products sourced from unauthorized channels (gray market)
- Products that look similar to trademarked designs (trade dress infringement)
- Replacement parts using brand names ("for iPhone" is a legal gray area — Apple enforces
  selectively)
- Wholesale lots of brand-name goods without invoices from authorized distributors

**Moderate Risk (Manageable with Care):**
- Generic products in categories where brands are active (phone cases, auto parts)
- Using brand names purely for compatibility ("fits Model X" with proper disclaimers)
- Refurbished branded products with clear condition disclosure

**Low Risk:**
- Truly generic, unbranded products
- Your own branded/private-label products
- Used items you personally owned (first-sale doctrine protects this, mostly)

### The "Compatible With" Trap

Many China-sourced products are designed to be compatible with brand-name ecosystems (phone
cases, printer cartridges, power tool batteries, etc.). The legality of using the brand name
for compatibility is nuanced:

- **Nominative fair use** allows you to mention a brand name to describe compatibility ("fits
  iPhone 15") — but only if you're clear it's not made by that brand
- **Some brands enforce anyway** regardless of fair use. Apple, Nike, Louis Vuitton, and many
  luxury brands will file VeRO claims even on legitimate compatibility claims
- **eBay sides with the brand owner** in most disputes. Being "technically right" doesn't save
  your listing or your account
- **Practical approach:** If the brand is on the active VeRO list, don't use their name at
  all. Describe the compatibility using model numbers or physical specifications instead

## eBay Seller Performance Standards

Your account health is measured continuously. These metrics matter:

### Transaction Defect Rate
Must stay below 2%. Defects include:
- Cases closed without seller resolution
- VeRO takedowns
- Late shipments (based on handling time you set)
- Tracking not uploaded on time

**Tip:** Your handling time setting is a promise. If you set 1-day handling but actually
ship in 3 days, that's a defect on every late order. Set realistic handling times —
especially if you're sourcing from China and might have inventory gaps.

### Late Shipment Rate
Must stay below 4%. Calculated based on your stated handling time.
**For China-sourced sellers:** Don't dropship from China with a 3-day handling time promise.
Either stock inventory domestically or set handling time to match your actual fulfillment
capability.

### Cases Closed Without Seller Resolution
Must stay below 0.3%. This is the hardest one. It means: if a buyer opens a case and eBay
has to step in to resolve it (rather than you resolving it directly with the buyer), that's
a defect.

**Practical guidance:**
- Respond to cases within 24 hours — always
- If the buyer has a legitimate complaint, refund or replace immediately. Fighting a $20
  refund isn't worth a defect
- If the complaint is illegitimate, provide evidence to eBay promptly (tracking showing delivery,
  photos of item condition pre-shipment)

## Restricted Categories

Some eBay categories have additional requirements or are outright restricted:

### Categories Requiring Pre-Approval or Special Handling
- **Electronics:** FCC compliance for radio-frequency devices. If it has Bluetooth, WiFi,
  or transmits any signal, it technically needs FCC certification. Most China-sourced electronics
  lack this. Enforcement is inconsistent but the liability is real
- **Beauty/health:** FDA implications for anything marketed with health claims. "Therapeutic"
  language in listings can trigger regulatory scrutiny
- **Batteries:** Shipping restrictions for lithium batteries. Products containing lithium
  batteries have carrier restrictions and may not be shippable via certain methods
- **Food/supplements:** Heavily restricted. Don't sell food products sourced from China on eBay
  without deep regulatory understanding
- **Children's products:** CPSIA compliance — lead testing, choking hazard labeling, tracking
  labels. Consumer Product Safety Commission enforces actively. China-sourced children's
  products that lack CPSIA compliance are a serious legal liability
- **Automotive parts:** May require fitment data in specific eBay format
- **Alcohol, tobacco, weapons, drugs:** Obviously prohibited

### The "No One Checks" Fallacy
The user may say "everyone else is selling this without [certification/approval]." This is
not a defense. eBay enforcement is algorithmic and complaint-driven — it can be dormant for
months and then sweep an entire category. Being the last one caught doesn't mean you won't
be caught.

## Returns Risk Management

Returns aren't just a cost — they're a compliance vector. Mishandling returns leads to defects,
and defects lead to account restrictions.

### Return Policy Strategy
eBay rewards generous return policies with better search ranking. The tradeoff:
- **30-day returns, buyer pays shipping:** Minimum acceptable policy. eBay will slightly
  penalize your search ranking vs. more generous policies
- **30-day returns, free returns:** Better search ranking. eBay doesn't charge a final value
  fee on the refund for free returns. But you eat return shipping costs
- **60-day returns:** Even better search ranking. Useful for building a new account

**The hidden economics:** A free return policy might cost you $3-5 per returned item in
shipping, but the improved search ranking might drive 10-20% more sales. Run the numbers
for your specific product category.

### Returns Red Flags for China-Sourced Products
- **Quality mismatch:** The #1 returns driver for arbitrage sellers. Product doesn't match
  listing photos (which may have been the supplier's aspirational images)
- **Size/fit issues:** For clothing and accessories, sizing from Chinese manufacturers rarely
  maps cleanly to US/EU sizes. Always include a size chart with actual measurements
- **Fragile items arriving damaged:** Inadequate packaging from supplier + international
  transit = broken products = returns + defects
- **"Not as described" claims:** If the buyer says "not as described" and eBay agrees, you
  pay return shipping AND get a defect. Accurate descriptions save accounts

## Suspension Risk Assessment

When evaluating any deal, run this quick assessment:

| Risk Factor | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| VeRO exposure | _ | 5 = brand actively enforces, 1 = generic/unbranded |
| Category restrictions | _ | 5 = regulated category, 1 = unrestricted |
| Compliance requirements | _ | 5 = FCC/FDA/CPSIA needed, 1 = none |
| Returns likelihood | _ | 5 = high-return category, 1 = low returns |
| Description accuracy | _ | 5 = hard to describe accurately, 1 = straightforward |

**Total above 15:** Don't proceed without deep compliance research
**Total 10-15:** Proceed with caution — mitigate each risk specifically
**Total below 10:** Standard risk — normal diligence is sufficient

## Common Compliance Mistakes to Flag

- **"Everyone else is doing it"** — not a compliance strategy. It's a shared risk pool that
  can drain suddenly
- **Using supplier photos as listing images** — if the supplier's photos show a branded item
  and yours is generic, that's misrepresentation
- **Claiming "new" for items without original packaging** — eBay's condition definitions are
  strict. "New" means sealed, original packaging, untouched
- **Dropshipping from China with US handling time** — if you promise 3-day handling and the
  item ships from Shenzhen, every order is a defect
- **Not disclosing country of origin** — some categories require it. Even when not required,
  hiding "Made in China" and having buyers discover it drives INAD claims
- **Selling safety-critical products without certification** — if it plugs into a wall or
  goes near a child, it probably needs certification you don't have
