# VeRO Quick Reference

> **Staleness Warning:** Brand enforcement is dynamic. Brands join and leave the VeRO program,

## Understanding VeRO Risk Levels

### How VeRO Enforcement Actually Works

Brand owners (or their contracted IP enforcement agencies like MarkMonitor, Corsearch, or
NetNames) run automated scans of eBay listings. They look for:
- Brand name in title or description
- Logos or trademarked images in photos
- Product identifiers (UPC/EAN) matching their catalog when sold by unauthorized sellers
- Pricing anomalies (too cheap = likely counterfeit in their view)
- Certain keywords + brand combinations ("replica," "style," "inspired")

When a match is found, the takedown is often automated — a human may never review the listing
before it's removed. This means **false positives happen**, and your listing can be killed
even if you're selling a legitimate product.

## High-Risk Brands (Active, Aggressive Enforcement)

These brands are known to file VeRO claims frequently and aggressively. Selling products
using these brand names from unauthorized channels is extremely risky:

### Fashion / Luxury
- Nike (including Jordan Brand, Converse)
- Adidas
- Louis Vuitton / LVMH group
- Gucci / Kering group
- Chanel
- Hermes
- Prada
- Rolex
- Cartier / Richemont group
- Ray-Ban / Luxottica
- Supreme
- The North Face / VF Corporation
- Lululemon
- Under Armour

### Electronics / Tech
- Apple (extremely aggressive — covers everything from products to accessories to "compatible with" claims)
- Samsung (selective but active)
- Bose
- Dyson
- Sony (selective)
- Microsoft (mainly software and Xbox)
- DJI (drones and accessories)
- GoPro

### Home / Consumer
- Yeti (very aggressive on drinkware and coolers)
- KitchenAid / Whirlpool
- Cricut
- Vitamix
- Keurig
- Stanley (drinkware — recently very aggressive)
- LEGO (extremely aggressive, covers compatible sets too)

### Beauty / Health
- Olaplex
- Dyson (hair tools)
- MAC Cosmetics / Estee Lauder group
- Bath & Body Works
- Scentsy

### Toys / Games
- LEGO (mentioned twice because they're that aggressive)
- Hasbro
- Mattel
- Disney (covers an enormous IP portfolio)
- Nintendo (both products and fan-made merchandise)
- Pokemon / The Pokemon Company

### Automotive
- OEM brands generally enforce when aftermarket parts use their trademarks
- Snap-on
- Tesla (accessories and merchandise)

## "Compatible With" Risk by Brand

Some brands enforce even on compatibility claims. Risk level for using "compatible with [Brand]":

| Brand | Risk of VeRO on Compatibility Claims |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| Apple | Very High — they enforce on "for iPhone," "iPhone compatible," etc. |
| Samsung | Moderate — less aggressive than Apple but active |
| LEGO | Very High — "compatible with LEGO" gets taken down regularly |
| HP/Canon (printer cartridges) | Moderate — enforcement is inconsistent |
| Dyson (vacuum parts) | High — they enforce on replacement parts claims |
| Keurig (K-cups) | Moderate — generic K-cup compatible pods are a gray area |
| Yeti | High — even "fits Yeti" on accessories gets flagged |

### Safer Alternatives to Brand Names
Instead of "Compatible with iPhone 15":
- "Compatible with 6.1-inch smartphone 2023 model"
- Use model number without brand: "Fits A2846, A2847, A2848"
- "Universal 6.1-inch phone case" (if it genuinely is universal)

These are imperfect solutions — they reduce VeRO risk but also reduce searchability.

## Enforcement Agencies to Know

These companies file VeRO claims on behalf of many brands. If you see a takedown from them,
it's a brand-authorized action:

- **MarkMonitor** — large portfolio of tech and luxury clients
- **Corsearch** — fashion, consumer goods
- **NetNames** — various brand categories
- **CSC Global** — corporate IP management
- **AppDetex** — specialized in marketplace enforcement
- **Yellow Brand Protection** — European brands

## VeRO Takedown Response

If the user gets a VeRO takedown:

1. **Don't relist the item.** Relisting after a VeRO takedown can result in immediate suspension
2. **Read the takedown notice carefully.** It identifies which IP right was allegedly violated
3. **Assess whether you have a defense:**
   - If selling genuine goods: first-sale doctrine may apply, but you need to prove authenticity
   - If selling compatible/generic goods: nominative fair use defense is possible but eBay
     rarely overturns takedowns
4. **File a counter-notice if you have a legitimate defense.** eBay will forward it to the
   rights owner, who has 10 business days to file a court action
5. **Contact the rights owner directly.** Sometimes faster than the formal process. Explain
   your position and ask for retraction
6. **If the takedown was invalid:** File an appeal through eBay's VeRO Counter Notice process.
   Have documentation ready (purchase receipts from authorized distributors, etc.)

## Safe Harbor Categories

These product types are generally lower VeRO risk for China-sourced goods:

- **Truly unbranded generic products** — no brand names, logos, or trademark-adjacent terms
- **Private label products** — your own brand (but make sure your brand doesn't infringe others)
- **Craft supplies and raw materials** — beads, fabric, components
- **Generic phone accessories** (without brand names in listing — market by phone model number)
- **Universal tools and hardware** — screwdrivers, brackets, generic fittings
- **Home organization products** — generic storage, organizers, labels
- **Pet supplies** (generic) — bowls, toys, beds without brand associations
- **Generic car accessories** — phone mounts, organizers, cleaning supplies

## IP Types Beyond Trademarks

VeRO covers more than just brand names:

- **Design patents:** The specific visual appearance of a product. China-sourced products that
  look identical to a patented design can be infringing even without using the brand name
- **Utility patents:** The functional mechanism. Some products are patented for how they work,
  not just how they look
- **Copyright:** Original creative works reproduced on products (artwork, characters, text).
  Disney characters on a phone case = copyright infringement regardless of brand name usage
- **Trade dress:** The overall commercial image/look. Distinctive packaging or product appearance
  can be protected even without a specific trademark

## The Bottom Line

If you're sourcing from China for eBay resale:
1. **Avoid brand names entirely** in your sourcing. Focus on generic, unbranded products
2. **If the product looks like a brand-name product** but doesn't carry the brand, it may
   still infringe on design patents or trade dress
3. **One VeRO takedown is a warning. Two is a crisis. Three can end your account.**
4. **When in doubt, don't list it.** No single product opportunity is worth your account
