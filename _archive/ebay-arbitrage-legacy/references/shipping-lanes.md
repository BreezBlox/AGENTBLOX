## Shipping Method Comparison

### Consumer / Small Parcel Methods

These are what you'll use when ordering from AliExpress or small Alibaba orders.

#### China Post / ePacket
- **Transit time:** 20-45 days (US), 25-50 days (EU)
- **Cost:** $2-8 for packages under 2kg
- **Tracking:** Basic — updates at origin and destination, often nothing in between
- **Weight limit:** 2kg (4.4 lbs)
- **Reliability:** Moderate. Packages occasionally disappear, especially during peak season
- **Best for:** Very low-value items where you can absorb occasional losses
- **Customs:** Usually flies under the radar for duties below de minimis thresholds ($800 US)
- **Note:** ePacket was the gold standard for years but has become slower and less reliable.
  Some carriers have replaced it with similar services under different names

#### AliExpress Standard Shipping / Cainiao
- **Transit time:** 15-30 days (US), 20-35 days (EU)
- **Cost:** $3-15 depending on weight and destination
- **Tracking:** Better than China Post — more frequent updates
- **Weight limit:** Varies, typically up to 5kg
- **Reliability:** Good. AliExpress/Cainiao has invested in logistics infrastructure
- **Best for:** AliExpress test orders — it's the default shipping option and reasonably reliable
- **Customs:** Same de minimis treatment as China Post for individual packages

#### Yanwen / SunYou / 4PX
- **Transit time:** 15-25 days (US)
- **Cost:** $5-15 for packages under 2kg
- **Tracking:** Moderate to good
- **Note:** These are third-party logistics providers commonly used by AliExpress sellers.
  Quality varies by provider and route

### Express Methods

For time-sensitive or high-value shipments.

#### DHL Express
- **Transit time:** 3-7 days (worldwide)
- **Cost:** $20-60+ per kg (volumetric weight may apply)
- **Tracking:** Excellent — real-time updates, signature on delivery
- **Weight limit:** No practical limit
- **Reliability:** Very high
- **Best for:** High-value items ($50+), urgent restocks, samples
- **Customs:** DHL handles customs clearance. Duties are assessed and charged to you or the
  buyer — make sure this is clear upfront
- **Warning:** Volumetric weight calculation means lightweight but bulky items get charged
  based on package dimensions, not actual weight. This surprises people

#### FedEx International
- **Transit time:** 3-7 days
- **Cost:** Similar to DHL
- **Tracking:** Excellent
- **Notes:** Similar profile to DHL. Some routes are cheaper with FedEx vs. DHL — compare both

#### UPS International
- **Transit time:** 3-7 days
- **Cost:** Similar to DHL/FedEx
- **Notes:** Less commonly used from China but competitive on certain routes

### Freight Methods

For bulk orders (50+ units or 20+ kg).

#### Air Freight (Cargo)
- **Transit time:** 7-15 days (door to door including customs clearance)
- **Cost:** $5-10 per kg (varies by route, season, and volume)
- **Minimum:** Usually 45kg or 0.5 CBM (cubic meter)
- **Tracking:** Via freight forwarder — less granular than express
- **Customs:** You'll need a customs broker (or your freight forwarder handles it)
- **Duties:** Full customs assessment — have your HTS codes ready
- **Best for:** 50-500 unit orders where express is too expensive and sea is too slow
- **Note:** "Air freight" means cargo hold of a passenger plane or dedicated cargo plane.
  Different from express courier — less hand-holding, lower price

#### Sea Freight (FCL - Full Container Load)
- **Transit time:** 30-45 days ocean transit + 7-14 days for customs and domestic delivery
  = 40-60 days total
- **Cost:** $2,000-5,000 per 20ft container (rates fluctuate dramatically)
- **Minimum:** Full container (20ft or 40ft) — 28-33 CBM for a 20ft container
- **Best for:** Large-scale operations with 500+ units and storage space
- **Not practical for:** Most eBay arbitrage sellers starting out

#### Sea Freight (LCL - Less than Container Load)
- **Transit time:** Same ocean transit, but add 5-10 days for consolidation/deconsolidation
  = 45-70 days total
- **Cost:** $50-150 per CBM (but with minimum charges that make small shipments expensive per unit)
- **Minimum:** Usually 1 CBM or 500kg, whichever is greater
- **Best for:** Medium orders that are too big for air freight but too small for a full container
- **Warning:** LCL shipments have more handling events = higher damage risk

## Customs and Duties

### US Import Basics
- **De minimis threshold:** $800. Individual packages valued under $800 generally enter
  duty-free. This is why small AliExpress orders usually don't incur duties
- **Above $800:** Full customs assessment based on HTS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule) code
- **Section 301 tariffs:** Additional 7.5-25% tariff on many Chinese goods. This is ON TOP
  of the regular duty rate. Check your specific product's HTS code
- **Customs bond:** Required for commercial imports over $2,500. Your freight forwarder can
  arrange this

### Common Duty Rates for eBay-Popular Categories
| Product Category | Approximate Duty Rate | Section 301 Additional |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Phone cases (plastic) | 3.4-5.3% | +7.5-25% |
| Clothing (synthetic) | 14.9-32% | +7.5% |
| Electronics (general) | 0-3.9% | Varies (some exempt) |
| Toys | 0-6.8% | +7.5-25% |
| Watches | 6.4-14% | +7.5-25% |
| Jewelry (costume) | 8-11% | +7.5% |
| Tools | 0-8.5% | +7.5-25% |
| Home textiles | 6-12% | +7.5% |

> These rates are approximate. HTS classification can be complex — similar products can
> have very different duty rates depending on material composition, intended use, and
> specific classification. When in doubt, consult a customs broker.

### EU Import Basics
- **De minimis threshold:** EUR 150 for customs duties (VAT applies from first euro)
- **VAT:** Import VAT applies on all goods entering the EU (typically 19-27% depending on
  country). This is a significant cost that US-focused guides often omit
- **IOSS (Import One-Stop Shop):** For goods under EUR 150, sellers can register for IOSS
  to charge VAT at point of sale rather than at import

## Shipping Decision Framework

### For Test Orders (1-10 units)
Use whatever the AliExpress seller offers. The priority is speed-to-test, not cost
optimization. Eat the $3-15 shipping cost as a testing expense.

### For Validation Orders (10-50 units)
Compare AliExpress Standard vs. a freight forwarder's air parcel service. At 10+ units,
a freight forwarder may be cheaper per unit than individual AliExpress parcels.

### For Scale Orders (50-200 units)
Air freight through a freight forwarder is almost always the best balance of cost and speed.
Get quotes from 3+ forwarders — rates vary significantly.

### For Volume Operations (200+ units)
Consider sea freight if you can handle the 45-60 day timeline and have storage space. The
per-unit cost savings are dramatic. Mix sea freight for base inventory with air freight for
fast replenishment.

## Freight Forwarder Selection

For anything beyond AliExpress standard shipping, you'll want a freight forwarder. They
handle the logistics chain from supplier to your door.

**What to look for:**
- Experience with your product category (some specialize in electronics, textiles, etc.)
- Door-to-door service (not just port-to-port)
- Customs brokerage included or arranged
- Clear pricing with no hidden fees (fuel surcharge, terminal handling, documentation fees —
  ask about ALL of them)
- Communication responsiveness — you want someone who answers within 24 hours

**Popular options for small eBay sellers:**
- FreightOS (online marketplace for freight quotes)
- Flexport (tech-forward, good for medium volume)
- Alibaba Logistics (built into Alibaba orders)
- Local customs brokers who also handle freight

**Red flag:** A freight forwarder who can't give you an all-in door-to-door quote. If they
quote only ocean freight and you have to figure out customs, drayage, and domestic delivery
separately — you'll get surprised by costs.
