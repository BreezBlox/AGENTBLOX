# Supplier Vetting Checklist

AliExpress-only policy: use this checklist for AliExpress suppliers. Do not use Alibaba, 1688,
or DHgate links in this workflow.

## Scoring System

Each section scores 0-10. Total possible: 70 points.

| Total Score | Recommendation |
|------------|---------------|
| 55-70 | Strong supplier — proceed with confidence (still order sample first) |
| 40-54 | Acceptable with caution — order sample, validate thoroughly |
| 25-39 | Risky — only proceed if no better options and margins justify the risk |
| Below 25 | Do not proceed |

## Section 1: Store/Seller Credibility (0-10)

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Store age 3+ years | +3 | Under 1 year = 0 points |
| Store age 1-3 years | +1 | Moderate signal |
| Positive feedback rate >95% | +2 | Below 90% = 0 and consider this a red flag |
| Transaction volume >500 orders | +2 | Under 100 = 0 points |
| Responds to messages within 24 hours | +2 | Test this before scoring |
| Top Rated / Store badges (AliExpress) | +1 | Nice to have but paid status — not definitive |

**Red flags that override scoring:**
- Multiple reviews mentioning "scam" or "fake" → stop evaluation
- Store has been recently created but claims years of experience → suspicious
- No product reviews at all despite high "order" count → possibly fabricated

## Section 2: Product Listing Quality (0-10)

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Original photos (not stock/catalog images) | +3 | Reverse image search to verify |
| Detailed product specifications with measurements | +2 | Vague specs = quality uncertainty |
| Multiple product photos from different angles | +2 | 5+ photos is good |
| Clear material/component descriptions | +2 | "High quality material" is not a specification |
| Honest about limitations or variants | +1 | Overselling is a yellow flag |

**How to spot stock photos:** Right-click → "Search image with Google." If the exact same
photo appears on 50 other stores, it's a stock photo. The product you receive may look nothing
like it.

## Section 3: Review Quality Analysis (0-10)

Don't just look at the star average. Read the reviews strategically:

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Reviews include buyer photos matching listing | +3 | Best quality signal available |
| 2-3 star reviews describe minor issues (not dealbreakers) | +2 | These are the most honest reviews |
| Review content is substantive (not just "good" or "nice") | +2 | AI-generated and incentivized reviews tend to be vague |
| No pattern of "item doesn't match description" complaints | +2 | If 3+ reviews say this → do not proceed |
| Recent reviews (within 90 days) are consistent with older ones | +1 | Quality drop-off over time is common |

**Review reading strategy:**
1. Sort by "most recent" — quality can change over time
2. Read ALL 2-3 star reviews — they contain the real quality signal
3. Look at photo reviews specifically — do they match the listing?
4. Check if negative reviews are about the product or about shipping (shipping complaints
   are less concerning for your evaluation of the supplier's product quality)

## Section 4: Communication Quality (0-10)

Message the supplier before ordering. Ask a specific question about the product (not just "is
this good quality?"). Evaluate the response.

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Responds within 24 hours | +2 | Over 48 hours = 0 points |
| Answers your actual question (not a template response) | +3 | Template responses = low engagement |
| Willing to send additional real photos | +2 | Refusal is a yellow flag |
| Can discuss customization/variations clearly | +2 | Shows product knowledge |
| Doesn't pressure you to order immediately | +1 | Pressure tactics = red flag |

**Good test questions to ask:**
- "Can you send me a photo of the actual product in your warehouse right now?"
- "What is the weight of this product without packaging?"
- "What's the difference between this product and [competitor's similar listing]?"
- "What's your defect rate for this product?"

Honest suppliers will answer these directly. Evasive answers or obvious copy-paste responses
are a signal.

## Section 5: Pricing Sanity Check (0-10)

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Price aligns with comparable suppliers (within 20%) | +3 | Dramatically cheaper = quality cut or bait-and-switch |
| Clear price breaks for volume (visible and reasonable) | +2 | Shows legitimate wholesale operation |
| No hidden fees mentioned in fine print | +2 | Shipping, packaging, labeling surcharges |
| Price is sustainable (not a loss-leader promotional rate) | +2 | "Limited time 90% off" = unsustainable |
| Accepts Trade Assurance / platform payment | +1 | Requesting off-platform payment = high risk |

**The "too cheap" trap:** If a supplier's price is 40%+ below all competitors for the same
product, ask why. Either the product quality is significantly lower, the listing is
misrepresented, or it's a scam. There's no free lunch in Chinese manufacturing.

## Section 6: Shipping and Logistics (0-10)

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Clear shipping method options with estimated delivery times | +2 | Vague "fast shipping" = unreliable |
| Package weight and dimensions available | +2 | Needed for accurate shipping cost calculation |
| Tracking number provided and valid | +2 | Test with past buyer reviews if possible |
| Reasonable packaging (not just a thin poly bag for fragile items) | +2 | Ask about packaging specifically |
| Willing to use your preferred shipping method | +2 | Flexibility is a good sign |

## Section 7: Brand / IP Safety (0-10)

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Product is genuinely unbranded/generic | +4 | The safest option for eBay resale |
| No trademarked logos or brand names visible on product | +2 | Check packaging too |
| No design patent similarity to major brand products | +2 | "Looks like a Dyson" = design patent risk |
| Supplier doesn't claim the product is "authentic [Brand]" | +1 | This claim = counterfeit admission |
| Product packaging doesn't mimic a known brand's trade dress | +1 | Same colors/layout as a major brand = risk |

**Hard stop:** If the supplier offers branded products at wholesale prices and you don't have
authorization from the brand to resell — do not proceed. This is counterfeit territory
regardless of what the supplier claims about "factory overstock" or "outlet quality."

## Post-Vetting: Before First Order

Even after a supplier passes the checklist, take these steps before committing capital:

1. **Order a sample** (1-3 units via the fastest available shipping)
2. **Photograph and document the sample** against the listing
3. **Test the product** — not just an unboxing, but actual use for 3-7 days
4. **Check dimensions and weight** against what the supplier stated
5. **Assess packaging quality** — will it survive international transit?
6. **Run the landed cost calculation** with real numbers (actual weight, actual shipping quote)
7. **Do a final margin check** with the real landed cost — does the deal still work?

Only after all seven steps should you place a volume order.

## Re-Vetting Triggers

Re-evaluate your supplier when:
- Product quality drops vs. your original sample
- Communication becomes slower or less responsive
- Prices increase without clear market justification
- Shipping times extend beyond the agreed window
- You receive a product that differs from the sample/previous orders
- Defect rate exceeds 5% on any order
- They start asking for off-platform payment
